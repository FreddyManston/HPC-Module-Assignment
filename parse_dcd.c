/*
** Read and print first 10 timesteps and first 10 atoms per timestep in DCD files
** Look at dcdplugin.c and molfie_plugin.h for struct definitions
** The funtions called are very NOT thread safe, the following could cause data races:
**	  - A file handle remains open from open_dcd_read till close_file_read
**	  - dcd->x, dcd->y and dcd->z are overwritten each loop (among other properties)
**	  - timestep.coords are overwritten each loop
**	  - Probably other stuff? Also don't try to read the whole file into memory unless you have > 300GB of RAM
**
** If things start failing silently set NOISY to 1 on line 117 of dcdplugin.c (This might help or might not?)
**
** Only tested on MSVC 2017, probably works on gcc or clang. Also this will probably work in cpp but this also isn't tested.
** Tested with example_pn3_10RU_751frames.dcd, find the link in the chatroom.
** This file probably doesn't have memory leaks but the library code is copied from the internet so who knows.
** Message me if things break or don't work but try solve it yourself first.
